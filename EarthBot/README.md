# EarthBot

## Inspiration
As each day progresses, the Earth is slowly deteriorating. Pollution everywhere, extinct animals and endangered species, and the shortage of natural resources like water and energy are not looking too good for the human species. However, it's not too late, because by practising some environmental tips, we can save the earth.

## What it does
EarthBot is a Discord bot that is environmentally themed. As of the time of writing, EarthBot has three commands: earth!improve, earth!aquatic, and earth!land. These commands provide tips on improving the environment, facts about aquatic animals, and facts about land animals respectively.

## How I built it
EarthBot was built using my Discord.js starter code, several Google searches, and Node.js.

## What I learned
A whole lot of environmental tips and tricks.

## What's next for EarthBot
There's a lot more tips and facts to share within the bot, so EarthBot will definitely be expanded to include more features.
