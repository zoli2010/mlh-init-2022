# Superchatter

## What it does
Superchatter is a real-time chat application that allows you to chat with other Google accounts, all within your home (your browser, more specifically).

## How I built it
Superchatter was built using Google's Firebase for the database, account authentication, and analytic aspects of the chat application, whilst the main functionality of Superchatter was built using React. Some CSS and HTML also helped to make Superchatter magical.

## Challenges I ran into
There were plenty of times where the CSS didn't look right, or the React code had something undeclared, but it was mostly fine.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of creating a real-time, interactive chat app. Creating something like this was something that I thought I'd never do in a million years, but I did it.

## What I learned
A ton of React and Firebase skills.
