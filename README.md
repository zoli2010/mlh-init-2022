This Github repository contains (almost) all of the projects that I have submitted for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io/). This collection contains 39 projects (which are admittedly low-effort, due to the time constraints), all initially created from 27th June to 5th July.

As of the end of INIT 2022, I am ranked 23th on the INIT Leaderboards under the alias "foop", with a total of 186 points worth challenge submissions and event check-ins. I am a member of BLAHAJGang üçâü¶à, an extremely supportive and hyped-up guild within MLH.

## INIT 2022: Day 8

At of the time of writing this, there are 5 hours left until the Devpost submissions page closes for both the MLH weekly challenges and the MLH weekend challenges. I've basically completed everything there is to complete as this point (except for Jina's search hack, because my installations and dependencies are pretty broken so I can't exactly create a hack for that), and I'm writing this just to say how wonderful INIT 2022 has been.

I have been a long-time member of MLH, and I have participated in many hackathons. However, I have only participated in hackathons for the stickers and swag, meaning that I've never actually actively participated and coded with MLH. In fact, the past week was the first time I even sent a message in the MLH Discord server. 

MLH INIT 2022 was the first official event that I actively participated in. In 7 days, I joined BLAHAJGang and formed connections with more people that I could even think of previously. I could share my experiences and perspectives about code and technology with other developers and programmers, and I could have a laugh with other MLH members. This weeklong event also boosted my productivity tenfold, kept me busy in a time like this, and helped me break my personal record of most contributions in a day (previous 41 contributions on March 19th, now 56 contributions on June 30th).

All in all, MLH INIT 2022 was one of the best code-related events that I have participated in within my 14 years of life experience. It has inspired me to genuinely participate in future hackathons and events, as well as motivated me to do my best for my future self. This event has re-sparked my interest for coding, and it has brought me to meet new, like-minded individuals who share the same interests as me.
