# Colourful

## Inspiration
White is so cliche and bland. It's quite literally the vanilla of colours. Even vanilla ice cream looks white. What's more, a bright, white light can be irritating to your eyes when you're midnight-hacking or suddenly transitioning from a dark mode interface to a light mode interface. Colourful solves all that by not only providing you with a smooth, black background, but other colours as well!

## What it does
Colourful is a Chrome Extension that helps you to change the background of your focused tab. The extensions isn't 100% accurate, but it works pretty well.

## How I built it
This project was built using HTML, CSS, JS, and some JSON.

## What I learned
I learned about the basics of Chrome Extension development.
