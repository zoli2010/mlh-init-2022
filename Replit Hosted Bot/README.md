# Replit Hosted Bot

This basic Discord bot was created as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io/): Day 4.

## What it does
The Replit Hosted Bot is a Discord bot that is hosted on Replit, which is why it's named "Replit Hosted Bot". I have made this bot very simple, with only two commands that tell the bot to reply with a message.

## How I built it
This bot was built using Discord.js, Node.js, and Express.
