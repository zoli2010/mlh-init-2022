# The Art of Speeching

## Inspiration
Simple input games nowadays are boring. Keyboard, mouse, gaming controller, touchscreen controls, the list of tapped and milked control methods just goes on and on. Many people don't even have a gaming controller (or even a keyboard or a mouse). But you know what's unique, special, 100% original, and accessible? Your voice. Most people (not all, unfortunately) have a voice, and that's all you need to play The Art of Speeching.

## What it does
The Art of Speeching is a speech recognition game that utilises the speech_recognition module in Python. The goal of the game is to guess what word the computer is thinking of. By speaking (or screaming, it's up to you) into your microphone, you can make a guess. But beware, 3 strikes and you're out!

## How I built it
This game was built Python and the speech_recognition module.

## Challenges I ran into
The speech recognizer wasn't entirely accurate, and there were quite a lot of times where the recognizer either heard my words wrongly, or it wasn't able to make out anything.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
It felt good to create a non-traditional input game. All the input games I've coded always included a keyboard (guess I was a bit hypocritical in the inspiration section, haha), so creating an input game with another, more accessible input method was great.

## What I learned
In building this project, I got the hang of Python's speech recognizer, as well as how to create a speech game using it.
