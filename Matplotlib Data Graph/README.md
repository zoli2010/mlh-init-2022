# Matplotlib Data Graph

This data visualization tool was built as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io): Day 3.

## What it does
This Matplotlib Data Graph tool prompts you to input a starting year and an ending year. You then input data values for two datasets, and the program plots a line graph for you.

## How I built it
This project was built using Python and the matplotlib.pyplot module. I had learnt some data visualisation skills academically, and I put those skills to good use by creating this small project.

## Challenges I ran into
One challenge that I faced was getting the program to let the user choose the amount of datasets that they have, but it's pretty late at the time of writing this, thus I decided to leave that feature for another day.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
To be honest, this is the first _real_ project that I've built using matplotlib.pyplot module, and I'm rather proud of that.

## What's next for Matplotlib Data Graph
More features, more redesigns, more functions.
