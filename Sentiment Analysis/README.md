# Sentiment Analysis

## Inspiration
Human beings are strange, especially if you're not that good at communicating. They say one thing, and you think that they mean this thing but apparently they mean that thing and it just combusts into a fiery ball of heated mess if you mess up enough. But for those who are absolutely terrible in social situations, don't fret, for why decode someone's messages when you can simply ask a computer to do it?

## What it does
This Sentiment Analysis project utilises Google's cloud technology and natural language processing to create a project that automatically detects whether a given phrase is positive, negative, or neutral.

## How I built it
This project was built by following [Google's Sentiment Analysis tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/sentiment-tutorial). This website takes you through the process of coding a sentiment analysis project, from signing up with Google Cloud to the main process using Python.

## What I learned
A ton of knowledge about sentiment analysis was garnered in the coding of this project (as well as the cloud computing technology that Google harnesses.)
