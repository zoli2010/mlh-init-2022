# Remindo

## Inspiration
Procrastination is hard to beat. Your memory isn't what it used to be. And you just can't find the time nowadays to do anything because even though you can't do anything, you're doing something.

Thus, Remindo exists, because I made it to overcome my own problems.

## What it does
Remindo is a Python program that prompts you to choose one of three options: display all reminders, schedule a new reminder, and delete all reminders. After choosing your choice, Remindo will do whatever you chose.

## How I built it
This was built using Python's schedule module, a module that I have used many times before and is probably overused by now.

## What's next for Remindo
Added functionality.
