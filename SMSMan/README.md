# SMSMan

## Inspiration
Think about a game of Hangman. Now, think about where that game of Hangman took place. Most likely, you thought of a whiteboard, a blackboard, a physical sheet of paper, etc, somewhere physical, in-person, and not remote at all. 

Presenting SMSMan, a game of Hangman that doesn't require human contact (at all, actually, because you're playing with a bot)!

## What it does
SMSMan is a game that can be played with the SMS app (Messages, whatever it's called on your phone). Simply ensure that you have a Twilio phone number, and text that number to start your hangman game. 

## How I built it
SMSMan was built using Twilio (quite evidently) and Express.js. I followed Twilio's game development tutorial and finished with this product.

## What I learned
I got some knowledge about Twilio's capabilities, as well as some more JavaScript skills (which really proves the point that you keep learning new things, even after a week of coding).
