# Manageword

## Inspiration
A password is a hassle to remember. All those pesky uppercase and lowercase letters, filled with numbers and special characters thrown left and right with the final result not even looking like a coherent term in any sort of language, as well as the common long-term password memory loss that's occurred to anyone without a photographic memory at least once. 

Manageword has your back, for it's a simple password manager in your terminal.

## What it does
Manageword is a password manager program that works in your terminal, your shell, your whatever. Upon running the program, you choose between 2 options: show passwords and create a new password. If you choose to show passwords, the program will print out all the passwords you have in the manager. If you choose to create a new password, the program will ask for your details, and save it in a text file.

## How I built it
This password manager was built using Python.
