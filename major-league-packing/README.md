# major-league-packing

This travel hack was built as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io): Day 3.

## Inspiration
Major League Packing was built by following the Travel Hack workshop on Twitch today, but the main inspiration was MLH's April Fool's Joke in 2015, where they [renamed themselves to Major League Packing](https://news.mlh.io/major-league-hacking-now-major-league-packing-04-01-2015).

## What it does
MLP is a travel-themed hack that is designed to help you organise and keep track of the things that you should be doing while relaxing. With MLP, you won't forget your flights, accommodation details, and your restaurant reservations.

## How I built it
MLP was built using Next.js, HTML and some CSS. 

## Challenges I ran into
I didn't run into anything too major or frustrating, but there were times where I accidentally inserted parentheses instead of curly brackets (and vice versa), which led to some errors and a couple of minutes wondering why the website doesn't work.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I had never really explored JavaScript libraries apart from React and Helmet, so I feel that getting to know what Next.js is broadened my capabilities in the JavaScript sector.

## What I learned
Prior to the Travel Hack workshop, I had never heard of Next.js. The workshop and this travel hack brought me into some of the basics and capabilities that Next.js offers.

## What's next for Major League Packing
MLP might go through some redesigns, if I'm keen enough. Some font changes, better colour schemes, added functions, etc.
