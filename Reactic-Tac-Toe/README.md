# react-tic-tac-toe

This Tic-Tac-Toe game was coded as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io): Day 3.

## What it does
Reactic-Tac-Toe functions like a simple game of tic-tac-toe: it's a 2-player game (at least I hope so) in which one player is the "X" and the other player is the "O". Players take turns drawing their respective symbols on the 3x3 grid: whoever manages to align 3 of their symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins!

Reactic-Tac-Toe also features spooky _time travel,_ where you can navigate through past moves and continue playing based on that past move.

## How I built it
Reactic-Tac-Toe was built using React, HTML, and CSS. The tutorial for this project can be found on React's website, in which they bring you through the components of the game - Board, Game, Square - and help you to create a tic-tac-toe game for yourself.

## What I learned
There were plenty of React tips and tricks that were showcased in this project, and I can say that although this game of tic-tac-toe seems simple, there is a lot of work put behind it, as well as many learning opportunities.
