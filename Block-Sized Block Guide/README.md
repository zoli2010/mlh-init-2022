## Inspiration
"What the hell is blockchain?"

These are words that you most likely have uttered in the past couple years, after the explosion of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin took place. To many, blockchain is a strange, otherworldly concept that they'll definitely won't grasp anytime soon.

But the thing is that blockchain isn't complicated at all. The Block-Sized Block Guide aims to provide you with some beginner information as to what this mysterious thing is.

## What it does
The Block-Sized Block Guide is a beginner's guide to what blockchain is, why we use blockchain, and how blockchain even works. Confused about what the difference between blockchain and bitcoin is? Never fret, for the webpage clearly explains what the difference between those two is, as well as more important concepts concerning blockchain.

## How I built it
This was built using some HTML and CSS. I reused the code in my Leaf-Sized Mongo Guide.

## Challenges I ran into
Blockchain technology is a tricky concept, and it did take me a while to even understand the concept of blockchain before I could create a webpage to share my knowledge and impart my knowledge onto others.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I had a blast in taking the time to learn what blockchain technology is. Due to the recent skyrocket in cryptocurrency lately, I had a lot of interest in getting to know what the basics of blockchains were, and I can say that I am proud of creating a project like this.

## What I learned
Almost everything within the webpage is a summary of what I learned. What blockchain was, why blockchain was useful, some common misconceptions that concerned blockchain, blockchain architecture (such as hashes, proof of work and P2P networks), blockchain transaction methods, and the versions of blockchain.

## What's next for Block-Sized Block Guide
I'll continue to research more about blockchain technology, and update the website as I go on.
