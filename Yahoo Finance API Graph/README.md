# Yahoo Finance API Graph

## Inspiration
With the sudden surge in interest in GME, AMC, and other stocks in 2020 and 2021, along with phrases such as "Diamond Hands" and "To The Moon" being thrown around in stock subreddits such as r/wallstreetbets, a line graph tool to represent the rise and fall of stock prices in the past decade or so.

## What it does
Yahoo Finance API Graph is exactly what its name says, albeit being a bit of a mouthful. Simply enter the abbreviated name of the stock you're looking for (e.g. AAPL), and it will output a line graph depicting the growth of that stock.

## How I built it
This handy tool was built using Python, along with datetime, numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and of course, the Yahoo Finance API.

## Challenges I ran into
It was a hassle deciding which finance hack I wanted to code. Tezos looked interesting, but I felt that it was a tad too complicated and out of my league. NeuralNine's video on stock price prediction was definitely interesting, but I didn't have the willpower nor the time to deal with neural networks and machine learning. I settled on Yahoo's Finance API after a round of Googling and whipped up some Matplotlib.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
It feels good to put my data science skills to use. I had definitely worked with Matplotlib in previous projects in this wonderful event, but my passion for data and graphs just makes me proud every time I manage to plot large amounts of data.

## What I learned
I learned quite a bit about financial hacks and APIs. Yahoo Finance API was extremely simple to work with and was almost a no-brainer.
