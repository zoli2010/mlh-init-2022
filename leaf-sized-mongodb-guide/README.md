# mini-mongodb-guide

This leaf-sized educational project was coded as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io/): Day 2.

My good friend [James Aiker](https://github.com/kombuken) took some time out of his busy academic schedule to work on this with me, props to him!

## Inspiration
This educational project was built around MongoDB as we believed that MongoDB was an extremely useful NoSQL database that every programmer had to know and learn about at least once in their lifetime. We also got some inspiration and reference to other MongoDB tutorials.

## What it does
This leaf-sized, mini MongoDB web guide grabs your hand and brings you for a quick walk amongst the forestial wonders of the intertwining trees and leaves that is MongoDB. It brings you through some introduction to MongoDB itself, giving you some information about what MongoDB is, why you should use it, as well as some general trivia about it. The installation process tells you how you can install MongoDB on your machine in some simple steps. Lastly, the "Getting Started" section shows you some common commands that you can use with MongoDB, showcasing the various features that it is capable of.

## How we built it
This project was built using HTML and CSS. Both of us had some knowledge of MongoDB, and we decided to create an educational project using our skills. 

## Challenges we ran into
There were times where we were unsure about certain aspects of MongoDB, such as the commands and the general trivia. Luckily, there were other resources online, such as _ahem_ Wikipedia and other more comprehensive online guides, which we used for reference from time to time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It was a great accomplishment for both of us to work alongside each other and succeed in our project. Many of the projects that both of us have built were only built alone, or with fresh faces. 

## What we learned
We learned some technical writing skills, as well as web development skills that would be useful in case one of us decided to write a documentation for a language or a service of some sort.

## What's next for A Leaf-Sized MongoDB Guide
The guide isn't complete, as there are still some terms that require explanation, and the CSS style for the code blocks aren't too pretty. Nevertheless, the Leaf-Sized MongoDB Guide will hopefully undergo some design changes.
