# RNG

This random number generator was coded as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io): Day 4.

## Inspiration
If you felt that everything in your life was too organised, too manageable, and too predictable, fear not, for this random number generator will add a spice to your life since you can't accurately predict what number this RNG will spit out.

## What it does
RNG is a random number generator program built using Python. It utilises the random module to generate and print out a random number between two numbers of your choosing.

## How I built it
This random number generator was built using Python, as well as a quick glance at the random module documentation.
