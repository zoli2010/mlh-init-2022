# Space Invaders

## Inspiration
Space Invaders is a pretty fun game. Aliens move towards you in this highly inefficient and slow manner, whilst you're in a cool spaceship capable of destroying the aforementioned aliens in one hit. There's also a time limit (I think?) and it's do or die for you.

Now, what if you made that using Kaboom.js? That's what this is.

## What it does
Space Invaders (my one) uses the concept as Space Invaders (the original one) in which the player is in a spaceship capable of shooting and destroying entities, but can only move left and right whilst the aliens move in a very peculiar manner.

## How I built it
Space Invaders (my one) was built with the help of Replit and Kaboom.js, which is basically an extremely fun-to-code-with Javascript game development library module collection etc. 

## Challenges I ran into
Like with most projects, there were lots and lots of bugs. Missing commas, incorrect usage of functions, etc, but a little bit of deep breathing and debugging helped me overcome those bugs and create this game.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of creating a knock-off Space Invaders. I like to play games, and apparently I like to make games, too.

## What I learned
I learnt quite a lot of Kaboom.js and how to code with it.
