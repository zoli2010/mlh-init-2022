# mlhinit2022-python-calculator

This project was created for [MLH INIT 2022](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/6813-init-2022): Day 1.

## What it does
The Python Calculator is, well, a calculator written in Python. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of 2 numbers.

## How I built it
This project was a fairly simple one. I created some starting messages that will prompt you to enter numbers as you use the calculator, and some two-liner functions that handled the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. I then slapped some if-elif-else statements into it, and called it a day.

## Challenges I ran into
As aforementioned, this project was fairly simple. The hardest challenge that I could think of was getting the program to display a readable error message and exit the program.

## What I learned
Although this project didn't teach me much, it definitely helped me to brush up on some features of Python that needed revising.

## What's next for Python Calculator
Python Calculator may expand from a simple 4-operator program to supporting algebraic equations. I might turn Python Calculator into a mobile application or a website.
