# Twitch Follower Bot

## What it does
Twitch Follower Bot is a Discord bot that uses the Twitch API to notify you whenever someone follows your Twitch channel by sending an embed in a Discord channel of your choosing.

## How I built it
This bot was built using Discord's bot API, along with Twitch API, wrapped in a little nice package that's coded in Node.js.

## What I learned
Because I've worked with Discord's API before, I didn't learn much Discord-wise, but I learnt some tips and tricks about the Twitch API. 

## What's next for Twitch Follower Bot
Twitch has many capabilities within their API, so I could consider expanding Twitch Follower Bot into something bigger, to a fully-functioning, fully-fledged Twitch bot instead of a simple follower alert bot.
