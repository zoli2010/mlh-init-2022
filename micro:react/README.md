# micro:react

This mini reaction time test was created as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io): Day 3.

## Inspiration
Last year, I spent 4 months learning and experimenting around with micro:bits. Making music projects, creating portable step counters, measuring temperature and time, and other sensors. As a personal, nostalgic throwback to my 2020 journey in hardware, I decided to revisit the (online) micro:bit and create a reaction time test for the micro:bit.

## What it does
micro:react is a reaction time test using a micro:bit. By pressing button A, the game starts, and the program is paused for a random unit of time before displaying a target on the screen. When the target shows, press button B as quickly as possible. The time between the displaying of the target and the button press will be scrolled horizontally after pressing button B.

## How I built it
I had nearly forgotten everything about micro:bits, so I looked at some previous code that I had in reserve, and I utilised some of the functions I used last year to create this program. The program was written in MicroPython, and executed using an online micro:bit.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I was glad to be able to put the skills that I had learnt last year to good use whilst having a blast of a time hacking at this event.
