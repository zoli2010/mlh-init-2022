# Fridge Feeder

This food recipe generator was created as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io): Day 4.

## Inspiration
From time to time, I stroll around in the kitchen and stare mindlessly into the fridge in the dead of night, wondering what delicious meal I can make to satisfy my midnight cravings, and I'm sure many others have too. Thus, I decided to create the Fridge Feeder (that feeds you, not the fridge), a recipe maker based on ingredients in your fridge.

## What it does
Fridge Feeder utilises the Spoonacular API (as well as some Python Flask magic) to create a webpage that helps you to identify what scrumptious and filling recipes you can make by simply inserting the contents of your fridge.

## How I built it
This project was built using Python and Flask, along with reference to the Spoonacular API documentation and an API key from the RapidAPI dashboard.

## Challenges I ran into
There was some trouble in getting the Flask app to start, as well as some time to understand the Spoonacular API (and RapidAPI) documentation, but they involved some bit of reading and a quick fix to overcome. One major challenge that I would have to say was that the free plan for Spoonacular in the RapidAPI requires a credit card number, which could be a major hindrance to anyone looking to make this project for themselves, but don't own a card.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of making my first kitchen hack. I've definitely had many restless nights mindlessly strolling around in my kitchen, looking for something to cook and gobble down, but I believe that this project will help me tons.

## What I learned
I learned about Spoonacular's API, as well as how to create a food recipe generator website.
