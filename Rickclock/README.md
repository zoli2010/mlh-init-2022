# Rickclock

## Inspiration
Waking up is hard. You hear the alarm clock, and your first instinct is to immediately close the alarm without thinking why you even set the alarm clock in the first place. If you're an extremely deep sleeper, sometimes you don't even hear the alarm clock. We also hate getting rick-rolled, it's been built into our system by now. 

So, why not combine those two things together and make the worst product possible?

## What it does
Bringing to you...the Rickclock! The Rickclock is a terminal alarm clock that opens up your web browser and plays Never Gonna Give You Up after a scheduled amount of time. Simply leave your computer up and running for the night and get your deep sleep disturbed by Rick Astley's voice!

## How I built it
This was built by combining two of my previous projects together: Schedulee and that other rickroll project that I couldn't find. Rickclock was built using Python, the schedule module, the webbrowser module, and sheer innovation.

## Challenges I ran into
Timings are tricky, and I had a problem with the schedule module. What if the user simply ignored the first song? How many times should I play the song? Yadda, yadda, yadda, etc. so I settled on the current code for this project.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of creating a pretty bad and annoying alarm clock.

## What I learned
How to annoy people with the use of technology.
