# bogosort

This terrible sorting algorithm was created as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/6813-init-2022): Day 2.

## Inspiration
It's bogosort. What more could you ask for?
[Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort) a Wikipedia page on the best list sorting algorithm out there.

## What it does
It grabs a list, randomises all the elements in the list, and checks whether the list is sorted. If not, randomise it, check it, rinse and repeat.

## How I built it
This was built using Python. I used a highly efficient sorting algorithm to check if a highly inefficient sorting algorithm worked. Also, ceaseless laughter after I found out that it worked motivated me to post this here instead of scrapping the idea and be a normal human being.

## Challenges I ran into
It was certainly challenging to assure myself that I was not insane.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I created a working bogosort algorithm. 

## What I learned
I learnt how to efficiently code one of the most inefficient sorting algorithms.

## What's next for An Actual Sort of Bogosort
It'll be incinerated in the near future.
