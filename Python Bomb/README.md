# self-destructing-python

This Python bomb was created as a project for [MLH INIT 2022](https://init.mlh.io): Day 3.

## Background
Mac users, don't you get tired when you're holding down that pesky command key and struggling to push your finger against one white letter encased around in an eerie, black background? Well, now you don't have to do a task as simple as that. By simply typing a 21-character installation command, a 65-character Python program, and a 16-character execution command, you can entirely evade those 2 painstakingly, difficult-to-reach characters on your keyboard. And if you click fast enough, this sneaky little Python Bomb could potentially detonate on that important project you've been working on for the past 2 weeks but never saved, instead of the terminal!

## What it does
Python Bomb is, well, self-explanatory. It utilises a Python module called pyautogui and help you to press "Command" + "Q", thus quitting whatever unfortunate application that you're currently focused on.

## How I built it
I initially started this project looking around for useless ideas that I could program. Then, that [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqk_nWAjBus&ab_channel=fxhm) of the machine with the metal hook pressing the button and then sliding back into its box slid into my mind, and it all went downhill from there.

I discovered that pyautogui was a thing that could help you to press your keyboard keys, and I programmed it to quit your current application.

## Challenges I ran into
Some of the challenges I ran into came before I even wrote my first line of code. There are many suggestions of useless programs out there, and I had trouble coding some of them. Also, I found out that pressing "Command + W" or "Alt + F4" didn't work on my machine, so I just went with "Command + Q".

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm just proud of managing to make this goofy little thing.

## What I learned
I learned how to use pyautogui, I suppose. It is a very neat little Python library, and I think it could be potentially helpful in future hacks and projects.

## What's next for Python Bomb
Nothing, really. This project is as simple as it should be, and as foolish as it should be.
