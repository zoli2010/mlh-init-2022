# Stepper

## Inspiration
Fitness tracker apps nowadays are too complicated. There are a million buttons on a million pages, and a million features on a million apps with millions of million-dollar companies run by millionaires milling a million developers whilst making millions. Instead of all that nonsense, Stepper provides you with a minimalistic style (some say it's _too_ minimalistic). Just a big, grey label called "Steps", along with a number that displays your hard-earned, gruellingly-painstaking steps that you take everyday.

## What it does
Stepper is an Android app built in Android Studio using Kotlin, and it displays the number of steps that you have taken by utilising your Android phone's internal motion sensor.

## How I built it
The one and only Sashrika Kaur led an amazing session thoroughly going through the details and processes that go into making a step counter. Through her wonderful enthusiasm, I simply watched the stream, took notes, and made Stepper.

## Challenges I ran into
Kotlin and Android Studio took some time getting used to. As a beginner in mobile application development, I have never touched anything like this before. There were some challenges in getting the app layout constraints just right, but Sashrika did clear some doubts for me and ultimately helped me overcome the challenges I faced.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of making my first Android app. I've always wanted to try coding Android applications for a long time now, but like any other person, I've been postponing it and procrastinating. Thanks to the Health App session, Stepper was created, and I feel pretty good about that.

## What I learned
I learnt plenty of Kotlin syntax, functions, modules, and whatnot. I learnt how to actually design an Android app using through some programming magic in activity_main.xml, and I learnt the ins and outs of creating apps using MainActivity.kt.

## What's next for Stepper
Obviously, a monotonous screen isn't going to be cut out of anyone. If I have time, Stepper will go through some wonderful design changes, making it more fascinating and enticing.
